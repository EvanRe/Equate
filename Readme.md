# Equate - Unit Converting Calculator
Equate is an open source unit converting calculator designed to make converting one unit to another fast and simple. 

For example, to convert 1/4 cup into tablespoons, type 1รท4, press cup, and then press tbsp.  That's it.  

To perform an even simpler conversion of one unit into another, say number of Bitcoins in a Dollar, simply click BTC and then USD. Only two button taps needed.
